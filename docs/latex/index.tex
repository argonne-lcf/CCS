 CCS aims at providing interoperability between autotuning frameworks and applications with auto-\/tuning needs. It does so by providing a C interface to describe autotuning problems and autotuners.

CCS has been greatly inspired by \href{https://github.com/automl/ConfigSpace}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/automl/\+Config\+Space}}, and was first thought as a drop in replacement for the engine of Config\+Space.

Preliminary Documentation can be found here\+: \href{https://argonne-lcf.github.io/CCS/index.html}{\texttt{ https\+://argonne-\/lcf.\+github.\+io/\+CCS/index.\+html}}
