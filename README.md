# CCS: C Configuration Space and Tuning Library

CCS aims at providing interoperability between autotuning frameworks and
applications with auto-tuning needs. It does so by providing a C interface to
describe autotuning problems and autotuners.

CCS has been greatly inspired by https://github.com/automl/ConfigSpace, and was
first thought as a drop in replacement for the engine of ConfigSpace.
